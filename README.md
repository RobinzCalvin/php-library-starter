## About

ramsey/php-library-starter-kit is a package that may be used to generate a basic
PHP library project directory structure, complete with many of the starting
files (i.e. README, LICENSE, GitHub issue templates, PHPUnit configuration,
etc.) that are commonly found in PHP libraries. You may use the project
directory that's created as a starting point for creating your own PHP libraries.

<!-- USAGE_START -->
## Usage

``` bash
composer create-project ramsey/php-library-starter-kit YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
```

Running this command will create a new repository containing the same files
and structure as this repository. Afterward, it will run the
`Ramsey\Dev\LibraryStarterKit\Wizard::start()` method to set up the project, which will
walk you through a series of questions and make changes to files based on your
answers. When complete, it will remove the `./src/LibraryStarterKit` and `./tests/LibraryStarterKit`
directories, leaving everything else in place with an initial commit.

## FAQs

### Why did you include package/tool *x* and not *y*?

I created this project starter kit for my own uses, and these are the
common files, packages, and tools I use in my PHP libraries. If you like what
you see, feel free to use it. If you like some of it but not all, fork it and
customize it to fit your needs. I hope you find it helpful!
